WARNING: [DRC PDRC-153] Gated clock check: Net AES1/ledDone_reg_i_1_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin AES1/ledDone_reg_i_1/O, cell AES1/ledDone_reg_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
